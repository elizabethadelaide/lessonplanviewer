#Lesson plan viewer

I created this as part of lesson prep for a large class. I needed to separate the content and presentation. The content is held on a google drive spreadsheet.

The web app uses angular js and mathjax to displat the curriculum.

A major issue was creating a watcher on the mathjax queue so that the divs would correctly resize after processing the math.
